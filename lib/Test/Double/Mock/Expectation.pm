=head1 NAME

Test::Double::Mock::Expectation - Mock expectation object

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item at_least

Modifies expectation so that the expected method must be called at least a minimum number of times.

=item at_most

Modifies expectation so that the expected method must be called at most a maximum number of times.

=item times

Modifies expectation so that the number of calls to the expected method must be within a specific range.

=item with(@args)

Assigns expected callee arguments.

=item returns($expected_value_or_subref)

Assigns expected returning value or subroutine reference.

=item verify

Verify how many times does method get called, and what parameters passed to method. Setting expectations that how many calling method by at_least() or at_most() or times() and what parameters passed by with().
